Q: React - How to get parameter value from query string?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35352638/react-how-to-get-parameter-value-from-query-string

Using component

<Route path="/users/:id" component={UserPage}/> 
this.props.match.params.id
The component is automatically rendered with the route props.


Using render

<Route path="/users/:id" render={(props) => <UserPage {...props} />}/> 
this.props.match.params.id
Route props are passed to the render function
