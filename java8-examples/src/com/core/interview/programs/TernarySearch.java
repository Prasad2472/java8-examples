		 * Ternary search is a decrease(by constant) and conquer algorithm that can be
		 * used to find an element in an array. It is similar to binary search where we
		 * divide the array into two parts but in this algorithm, we divide the given
		 * array into three parts and determine which has the key (searched element). We
		 * can divide the array into three parts by taking mid1 and mid2 which can be
		 * calculated as shown below. Initially, l and r will be equal to 0 and n-1
		 * respectively, where n is the length of the array.
		 * 
		 * It is same as the binary search. The only difference is that, it reduces the
		 * time complexity a bit more. Its time complexity is O(log n base 3) and that
		 * of binary search is O(log n base 2).
		 * 
		 * mid1 = l + (r-l)/3 mid2 = r â€“ (r-l)/3
